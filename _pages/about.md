I am a fourth year student from [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en). My research interests include multiple testing, causal inference, and high dimensional reduction methods. Outside of statistics, I am enthusiastic about film production, bouldering, and hip-hop dancing.

I am very fortunate to have the chance to be advised by [Prof. Jingshu Wang](https://jingshuw.org/) and [Prof. Nikolaos Ignatiadis](https://nignatiadis.github.io/) from the Department of Statistics at University of Chicago.

You can reach out to me via my email [baichen@uchicago.edu](mailto:baichen@uchicago.edu).
