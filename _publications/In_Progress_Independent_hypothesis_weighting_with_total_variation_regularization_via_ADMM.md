This project builts upon Prof. Nikolaos Ignatiadis's previous paper "Covariate powered cross-weighted multiple testing." We explored methods for determining the optimal rejection threshold in cases where p-values exhibit a piecewise linear distribution. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure can be viewed as an optimization challenge aiming to maximize discoveries while adhering to two constraints: (1) limiting the false discovery rate within a specified alpha threshold and (2) assigning non-negative weights to p-values. Consequently, the maximization problem can be transformed into a Lagrangian, involving both dual and primal problems. 

We are still working on the paper, you can read the draft [here](http://BaichenTan.github.io/files/In_Progress_Independent_hypothesis_weighting_with_total_variation_regularization_via_ADMM.pdf)
