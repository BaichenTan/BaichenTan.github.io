This project extends Prof. Qingyuan Zhao's paper "Powerful three-sample genome-wide design and robust statistical inference in summary-data Mendelian randomization" to a more general case. We consider two major adaptations on Zhao's method. First, we do not use multiple samples. Second, we assume the risk factors are multidimensional (i.e. the gene snippet affects the outcome variable via multiple risk factors.)

We are still working on the paper, you can read the draft [here](http://BaichenTan.github.io/files/%5BIn%20Progress%5D%20Statistical%20inference%20in%20one-sample%20summary-data%20Mendelian%20randomization.pdf)
