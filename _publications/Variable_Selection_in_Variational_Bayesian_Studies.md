This is an expository paper which examines and summarizes two papers "Sum of Single Effects model (SuSiE)" and "SparsePro: an efficient genome-wide fine-mapping method" that discuss variational Bayes approach in genome-wide association study (GWAS). Besides examination of the papers' method, I propose a new model that combines the SuSiE model and SparsePro model by assuming that gene snippets of various response types share a common prior.
